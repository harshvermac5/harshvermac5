Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Harsh Verma, just your friendly neighborhood *LinkedIn influencer* and passionate **network engineer**. Every day, I dive into the exciting world of IT, sharing cool stuff and making it less of a mystery. Right now, I'm on this journey exploring **Datacenter and Automation** â€“ trust me, it's like discovering a new level in a game!

I'm all about making IT feel like a warm welcome party, especially for those curious newbies. As a side gig, I'm on YouTube, dropping knowledge bombs and creating a little IT heaven for enthusiasts. And yeah, I'm chasing certifications like **CCNA** â€“ not because I'm a tech superhero, but because learning is just what I do.

So, hop on this educational rollercoaster with me, where we turn passion into expertise! ðŸš€ #ITEnthusiast #NetworkEngineer #ContinuousLearning
